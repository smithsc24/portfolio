## About

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a home for any small applications that I build during my time at NSCC-COGS, or any other small applications that I feel would serve well as portfolio pieces.
Currently it only serves as home for a single application, but the end goal should look something like the following:

- A home page with a brief about me
  - navigation to other pages
    - not sure if sidebar or header bar
- Hobby showcase
  - aquariums, pens I have made et cetera
    - I know these aren't necessarily exciting, but they are a good way to showcase that I am a real person who does stuff other than just work.

## Running this yourself

_NOTE:_
Since this is built using React, you will need to have node.js and npm installed

1. Either manually download the files or clone the repository.
2. In a terminal, navigate to the porject root
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm start`

## Updates

I will be periodically updating this portfolio as I have ideas, new photos or pages to add or functionality changes. For now, I have a few planned updates:
- Setting a default map when looking at the maps page.
  - Thhis should be working the way it is now, but it isn't. Not sure why
- Add a hobbies page:
  - Just some photos of my aquariums and pens I have made
  - Goal is to show that I do other creative things in my free time
  - This will be incredibly simple, just an image gallery
  - Each image will have a very simple description
- Data Retrieval:
  - Right now the way I am getting my data to populate the projects page is less than ideal
  - Plan is to change things up and use redux. While it probably isn't 100% necessary, it  would be good practice.
- Style updates:
  - This won't be anything that changes the appearance of elements, but rather moving commonly used items like colours to variables or utility classes.
