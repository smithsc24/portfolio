## About
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a home for any small applications that I build during my time at NSCC-COGS, or any other small apoplications that I feel would serve well as portfolio pieces.
Currently it only serves as home for a single application, but the end goal should look something like the following:

- A home page with a brief about me
  - professional experience
  - education
  - hobbies
  - navigation to other pages
    - not sure if sidebar or header bar
- Hobby showcase
  - aquariums, pens I have made et cetera
    - I know these aren't necessarily exciting, but they are a good way to showcase that I am a real person who does stuff other than just work.
- Projects/Assignments
  - This will be a sidebar with project names, and a main container
  - Selecting a project name will trigger a render that loads the chosen project into the main container

## Updates

I do not know how frequently I will update this repository, but I will add updates to this readme, and slowly build out a wiki as I do
